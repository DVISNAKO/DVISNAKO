Hello, on my page, ðŸ˜„

My name is Dmitry, and I'm from Latvia. 

I started learning coding on April 1st, 2022, and I enjoy it. 

For the past two years, I have worked as a QA tester in the biggest Latvian company, SIA Tet. 
I have a passion for IT and have been thinking about coding and practicing it. 
I began learning with free courses on YouTube and later purchased a big course on JavaScript and React on Udemy.com. 
Currently, I have completed a part of JavaScript and created a portfolio with some modules in JavaScript. 
I plan to learn React next and add some of my projects in React to my portfolio.
2023, I plan to dedicate to learning, and in 2024, I aim to secure my first job as a front-end developer.
